## Purpose

Admin platform settings for compliance, consent, feature flags, and integrations.

## User Flow

1. Review grouped settings.
2. Confirm sensitive changes.
3. Audit changes.
4. Keep secrets server-side.

## API Endpoints And Data

- Settings/app config table when available
- Audit event writes

## Validation

- Use react-hook-form with Yup resolver.
- Client validation mirrors server/database rules.
- Show inline errors and an accessible error summary.

## Reusable Components

- [[frontend/components/component-catalog#FormShell|FormShell]], [[frontend/components/component-catalog#ConsentBanner|ConsentBanner]]

## Skeleton Template

- Use [[frontend/templates/AppLayout|AppLayout]] with stable loading placeholders.
- Use [[frontend/components/component-catalog#EmptyState|EmptyState]] for no data and [[frontend/components/component-catalog#Error State|ErrorState]] for failures.
- Do not create one-off components when shared catalogue components cover the need.
