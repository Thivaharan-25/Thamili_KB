## Purpose

Manage delivery schedules, partner assignments, and delivery statuses.

## User Flow

1. Load schedules.
2. Filter by date/country/status/partner.
3. Create or update assignments.
4. Show partial failures.

## API Endpoints And Data

- CRUD: `delivery_schedule`
- Read `users` role delivery_partner
- Notifications

## Validation

- Use react-hook-form with Yup resolver.
- Client validation mirrors server/database rules.
- Show inline errors and an accessible error summary.

## Reusable Components

- [[frontend/components/component-catalog#DataTable|DataTable]], [[frontend/components/component-catalog#StatusBadge|StatusBadge]]

## Skeleton Template

- Use [[frontend/templates/AppLayout|AppLayout]] with stable loading placeholders.
- Use [[frontend/components/component-catalog#EmptyState|EmptyState]] for no data and [[frontend/components/component-catalog#Error State|ErrorState]] for failures.
- Do not create one-off components when shared catalogue components cover the need.
