## Purpose

Set the active market/country before product browsing and order placement.

## User Flow

1. Show supported country/market choices.
2. Persist guest country locally.
3. For authenticated users, update profile country preference.
4. Invalidate products, pickup points, and cart pricing.
5. Continue to home or dashboard.

## API Endpoints And Data

- Update: `users.country_preference`.
- Invalidate React Query keys for products, pickup points, cart pricing.

## Validation

- Use react-hook-form with Yup resolver.
- Client validation mirrors server/database rules.
- Show inline errors and an accessible error summary.

## Reusable Components

- [[frontend/components/component-catalog#FormShell|FormShell]], [[frontend/components/component-catalog#PageHeader|PageHeader]]

## Skeleton Template

- Use [[frontend/templates/AppLayout|AppLayout]] with stable loading placeholders.
- Use [[frontend/components/component-catalog#EmptyState|EmptyState]] for no data and [[frontend/components/component-catalog#Error State|ErrorState]] for failures.
- Do not create one-off components when shared catalogue components cover the need.
