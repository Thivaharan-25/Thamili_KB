# VerifyEmailPage

## Purpose

Guide users while email verification is pending.

## User Flow

1. Show verification instructions.
2. Allow returning to login.
3. Optionally allow resend verification if backend supports it.
4. If session appears, route onward.

## API Endpoints And Data

- Read Supabase v1 session with `supabase.auth.session()`.

## Validation

- Use react-hook-form with Yup resolver.
- Client validation mirrors server/database rules.
- Show inline errors and an accessible error summary.

## Reusable Components

- [[frontend/components/component-catalog#EmptyState|EmptyState]], [[frontend/components/component-catalog#FormShell|FormShell]]

## Skeleton Template

- Use [[frontend/templates/AuthLayout|AuthLayout]] with stable loading placeholders.
- Use [[frontend/components/component-catalog#EmptyState|EmptyState]] for no data and [[frontend/components/component-catalog#Error State|ErrorState]] for failures.
- Do not create one-off components when shared catalogue components cover the need.
